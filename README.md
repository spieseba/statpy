# statpy

This repository contains a set of Python tools developed for statistical analysis, primarily aimed at lattice QCD research. These tools were created during the course of my PhD work, including applications like short-distance window HVP analysis.

The toolset primarily offers robust statistical methods for analyzing large sets of observables across various ensembles, while remaining flexible enough to support a wide range of statistical tasks.
